## **Section 1: Phenomena of interest**
Inspired by the Coordinated AI Bot Influence model, we plan to simulate how social robots on social media platforms achieve collective goals through coordinated actions, such as promoting and amplifying specific information or hashtags to suppress opposing views. For example, social bots can strategically dilute and drown out opposing viewpoints by repeatedly posting and sharing information they like or liking relevant content. This behaviour shapes the information flow but also subconsciously influences people's perceptions because this will lead the users more easily to see and engage with the amplified content, which it also prevents users from seeing opposing views. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in mainstream social media platforms (such as X, and Instagram), where algorithmic recommendations and interactions between robots play a key role in content visibility and public opinion guidance. Through simulation, we hope to reveal how robot collaboration affects the dynamics of information dissemination and further explore its potential impact on public opinion formation.
