# Ground Rules

These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions. Below are examples of the types of areas it is important to address and examples of what form they might take.  

| **Area** | **Principles & Norms**<br><br>All members of the group agree to: |
| --- | --- |
| **Communication** | All members agree to communicate any changes or concerns related to the project.    |
| **Meetings** | All members must attend group meetings in a timely manner and contribute their ideas. If a member is unable to attend , the group must be notified ASAP.    |
| **Deadlines** | All group members must hand in their portion of tasks in a timely manner. In case of delays, they should notify the group early on.    |

| Care Statement<br><br>Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration: |
| 1. Team members support each other and respect each other's schedules and personal situations.
2. Team members communicate promptly, when encountering problems, the team members will help each other.
3. When team members face emergencies (such as time conflicts and personal issues), teammates will understand and flexibly adjust the task schedule. |
