# Coordinated AI Bot Influence - ABM Prototype

## Overview
This project simulates the influence of AI-driven social bots in online social networks using an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) approach with the Mesa framework. The goal is to explore how bots amplify engagement, manipulate discussions, and influence human users through algorithmic prioritization.

## Key Features
- âœ… **Social Network Graph**: Humans (blue) and Bots (red) interact in a dynamic network.
- âœ… **Content Interaction Simulation**: Simulates likes, shares, and retweets.
- âœ… **Algorithmic Influence**: Shows how bots boost engagement through platform algorithms.
- âœ… **Data Logging**: Records interactions in `interaction_log.csv`.
- âœ… **Agent-Based Modeling**: Uses **Mesa** for simulation and interaction scheduling.
- âœ… **Visualization**: Generates network graphs, interaction charts, and engagement trend analysis.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run Simulation**  
    ```
    cd src
    python run.py
    ```

# Limitations & Planned Improvements

## Current Features

- âœ… Basic social network graph with human users and bots.
- âœ… Simulated content interactions (likes, shares, retweets).
- âœ… Algorithm-based prioritization (exponential bot influence growth).
- âœ… Data logging of interactions.
- âœ… Visualization of agent interactions and engagement trends.

## Planned Improvements

- ðŸ”¹ Improve bot behavior (targeting influential users more effectively).
- ðŸ”¹ Advanced visualization (interactive network & detailed metrics).
- ðŸ”¹ Enhanced data analysis (user engagement patterns, sentiment impact).
- ðŸ”¹ Implement adaptive bot strategies to simulate real-world behavior more accurately.
